## Overview

Briefly explain the business or technical problem this project solves.

This project demonstrates:

- Secure AWS infrastructure design
- Infrastructure as Code using Terraform
- Automated validation through GitHub Actions
- Clear technical documentation
- Repeatable deployment and cleanup procedures

## 💰 Cost Management

This project is designed to be portfolio-friendly while minimizing AWS costs.

The following modules are intentionally disabled by default:

- Application Load Balancer
- EC2 Compute
- Auto Scaling
- Amazon RDS

The networking architecture, Terraform modules, validation workflow, and Infrastructure as Code structure can all be reviewed without deploying billable infrastructure.

To enable production deployment, set the appropriate module variables to `true` and review the Terraform plan before applying.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, install and configure:

- An AWS account
- AWS CLI
- Terraform
- Git
- Appropriate AWS credentials

Verify access:

```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
terraform version
```

## Deployment

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git
cd REPOSITORY
```

### 2. Configure variables

```bash
cd terraform/environments/dev
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
```

Update `terraform.tfvars` with your own values.

### 3. Initialize Terraform

```bash
terraform init
```

### 4. Validate the configuration

```bash
terraform fmt -check -recursive
terraform validate
```

### 5. Review the deployment plan

```bash
terraform plan
```

### 6. Deploy

```bash
terraform apply
```

## Validation

Describe how you confirmed the deployment worked.

Examples:

```bash
terraform output
aws ec2 describe-vpcs
```

Include screenshots in the `images/` folder.

## Cleanup

Destroy resources when finished to prevent unnecessary AWS charges:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

## Security Considerations

- Follow least-privilege IAM principles
- Do not commit credentials or secret values
- Encrypt data at rest and in transit
- Restrict inbound traffic
- Enable logging and monitoring
- Review Terraform plans before applying changes

## Cost Considerations

List services that may generate charges and describe any cost controls used.

Examples:

- Resource tagging
- Small development instance sizes
- Budget alerts
- Automatic cleanup
- Serverless or managed services when appropriate

## Lessons Learned

Explain what you learned while building the project.

- Technical lesson
- Design tradeoff
- Troubleshooting lesson
- Security improvement

## Future Improvements

- Add another environment
- Add automated tests
- Strengthen monitoring
- Add policy-as-code checks
- Improve disaster recovery
